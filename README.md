## About

lazyftp brings a familiar TUI experience to file transfers. If you live in the terminal and find
yourself constantly switching to a GUI client just to move files around — this is for you.

Dual-pane local/remote navigation, real-time transfer progress, FTP, FTPS and SFTP support, all
from the keyboard.

## Features

- FTP, FTPS and SFTP support, including SFTP password or SSH identity-file authentication
- Named connection profiles, including saved server passwords for quick reconnects
- Dual-pane layout — local and remote side by side, responsive down to an 80x24 terminal
- File size and modification date, sortable by name, size or date, with the exact byte count and
  full timestamp a keystroke away when the panel is too narrow to show them
- Fuzzy filtering and jump-to-path, so a deep or specific file is a few keystrokes away
- Create, rename and delete files and directories, on either panel
- Toggle hidden (dot) file visibility per panel
- `--highlight-diff` marks entries that differ between Local and Remote
- Real-time transfer progress with direction indicators, including recursive directory
  upload/download
- Multiple file selection and batch transfers, with direction-independent `U`/`D` shortcuts
- Keyboard-driven navigation (vim-style + arrow keys)
- A help screen (`?`) and a context-aware hints bar
- Scrollable transfer and connection log, and a scrollable process list

## Installation

### Download a binary

Packages and archives for Linux, macOS and Windows are on the
[latest release](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/releases/latest), for both x86-64 and arm64.
No Go toolchain needed.

Debian, Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i lazyftp_*_linux_amd64.deb
```

Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE:

```bash
sudo rpm -i lazyftp_*_linux_amd64.rpm
```

Anywhere else, unpack the archive and put `lazyftp` somewhere on your `PATH`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp.git
cd lazyftp
go build -o lazyftp .
```

### With go install

```bash
go install github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp@latest
```

---

## Usage

```bash
lazyftp
```

The local panel opens in the directory you ran it from.

| Flag | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `--verbose` | Show the FTP control dialogue in the Log panel |
| `--log-file <path>` | Write the log to a file as well, appending to it |
| `--no-nerd-fonts` | Use plain Unicode symbols instead of Nerd Font icons |
| `--highlight-diff` | Mark files that differ between Local and Remote (by name, and by size when both share a name) |
| `--version` | Print the version and exit |

### Connecting

Press `Ctrl+L` to open the connection dialog:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Proto | `FTP`, `FTPS` or `SFTP` — cycle with `←` / `→` |
| Host | Server hostname or IP |
| Port | Leave empty for the protocol's default: `21` for FTP and FTPS, `22` for SFTP |
| User | Username |
| Auth | SFTP only: choose **Password** or **Identity file** with `←` / `→` |
| Pass | FTP/FTPS password, or SFTP password when Password mode is selected |
| Identity | SFTP Identity file mode: path to your private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` |
| Key pass | Passphrase for an encrypted identity file; masked and optional for unencrypted keys |

In the SFTP dialog, use the **Auth** field to switch between password and identity-file login.
On the Identity field, press `Ctrl+O` to browse local files; you can also type a path directly.
The picker starts in `~/.ssh` when that directory exists, otherwise in your home directory. Use
`↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` to open a directory or choose a file, `Backspace` to go to its parent,
and `Esc` to return to the form.
Passphrases for encrypted keys are entered in the masked Key pass field. lazyftp reads the
identity file locally and does not log or save its contents.

After login, the Remote panel opens in the server-reported working directory, which is usually the
remote user's home. A chrooted or virtual SFTP server may report its visible root instead.

Press `Enter` to connect, `Esc` to close the dialog or give up on an attempt that is taking too
long. Once connected, the status line shows the protocol, user, host and connection state.

Saved connections can be selected from anywhere with `Ctrl+P`; choosing one fills in the
connection dialog, where `Enter` connects. Open the dialog with `Ctrl+L` and use `Ctrl+S` to save
the current settings. Profiles live in `~/.lazyftp/config.json`. Server passwords are stored there
in plaintext; on POSIX systems the directory and file are restricted to the owner (`0700` and
`0600`). Windows relies on the ACL of your home directory. SSH key passphrases are never saved.
Identity-file profiles remember only the key path.

FTPS certificates are verified, so a server with a self-signed certificate is refused.

### Transferring files

1. Navigate to the file or directory you want to transfer
2. Optionally mark multiple files with `Space`
3. Press `t` to transfer, or `U`/`D` to upload/download whichever side has marked files
   regardless of which panel has focus

If you are in the **local panel**, the file will be uploaded to the current remote path. If you are
in the **remote panel**, it will be downloaded to the current local path.

## Keybindings

The full reference — every binding, grouped by context — is also one keystroke away in the app:
press `?`.

### Global

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+L` | Open the connection dialog |
| `Ctrl+P` | Choose a saved profile |
| `?` | Help screen |
| `Tab` | Switch panel within the current group (Local/Remote, or Log/Processes) |
| `Shift+Tab` | Switch between the Local/Remote group and the Log/Processes group |
| `U` / `D` | Upload / download whichever side has marked files, regardless of focus |
| `q` / `Q` | Quit |

### File panels (Local, Remote)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓`, `k` / `↑` | Move down / up |
| `l` / `Enter` | Open directory, or show a file's exact size and full timestamp |
| `h` / `-` / `Backspace` | Go up one level |
| `Space` | Mark / unmark file or directory |
| `t` | Transfer (upload or download depending on active panel) |
| `r` | Refresh the current directory listing |
| `s` / `S` | Cycle sort column / reverse sort direction |
| `:` | Jump to a path by typing it — `Enter` to go, `Esc` to cancel |
| `/` | Fuzzy-filter the listing — `Esc` to clear |
| `Ctrl+H` | Toggle hidden (dot) file visibility |
| `Ctrl+N` | Create a directory — `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel |
| `F2` | Rename the selected file or directory — `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel |
| `d` | Delete the selected or marked files — `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel |

### Log & Processes

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j` | Scroll up / down |
| `b`/`pgup`, `f`/`pgdn` | Page up / down |
| `Tab` | Switch between Log and Processes |

### Connection dialog

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Next field |
| `Shift+Tab` | Previous field |
| `←` / `→` | Change protocol or SFTP authentication mode (on the corresponding field) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Browse for an identity file (on the Identity field) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save or update a profile |
| `Enter` | Connect |
| `Esc` | Close, or abandon an attempt in progress |

### Identity file picker

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `k`, `↓` / `j` | Move through entries |
| `Enter` | Open a directory or select a file |
| `Backspace` / `←` | Go to the parent directory |
| `Esc` | Return to the connection dialog |

In the profile picker, use `Enter` to load a profile, `d` then `y` to confirm deletion (`n` or
`Esc` cancels), and `Ctrl+S` to save another. Saving an existing profile name asks for overwrite
confirmation (`y` to replace, `n` to return to the name field).

## Troubleshooting

**A connection fails and you want to know why.** Both flags together put the whole exchange in a
file you can attach to an issue. Passwords and key passphrases are masked.

```bash
lazyftp --verbose --log-file lazyftp.log
```

**FTPS is refused and the credentials are right.** The server most likely does not offer TLS.
Connect over `FTP` instead.
