# Roadmap

Where lazyftp is going and in what order. Each release is meant to be short and shippable
rather than a grab-bag; connectivity and stability come first, the interface second, and
features on top of solid ground.

Every item is tracked by an issue. Progress lives in the
[milestones](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/milestones).

What has already shipped is in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## v0.2.0 — TUI overhaul

The interface has never had a design pass. Measured against the terminal-UI checklist it
fails on several counts, the worst of which is quantifiable: **at the conventional 80×24
floor the file panels show two entries.** Fixed vertical budgets leave the panel eight rows,
and six of those go to chrome.

- [#23](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/23) **An explicit degradation plan across terminal sizes**, down to a "terminal too
  small" message instead of a broken render.
- [#24](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/24) **Connection bar becomes an overlay.** Five permanently bordered rows — a fifth of
  an 80×24 screen — are spent on a form used once per session.
- [#25](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/25) **Semantic color tokens.** Eleven raw palette codes across six files, with styles
  rebuilt on every row of every frame.
- [#26](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/26) **Help screen on `?`**, and a footer trimmed to the keys that fit in 80 columns.
- [#27](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/27) **Truncate by display width, not byte length** — accented filenames currently
  split mid-character.
- [#28](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/28) **Separate the cursor from the selection mark.** A file that is both marked and
  selected is distinguishable by background color alone.
- [#29](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/29) **Size and date columns.** Both are already collected for every file and never shown.
- [#31](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/31) **Fuzzy filter on `/`** with a match counter.
- [#30](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/30) **Sort by name, size or date** with a column indicator.
- [#32](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/32) Make the Log panel focusable and scrollable.
- [#33](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/33) Jump to a typed path.
- [#52](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/52) Mark entries present on only one side, by name — comparing sizes or timestamps is
  not reliable over plain FTP.

## v0.3.0 — File operations

These four share one inline-input pattern — `Enter` confirms, `Esc` cancels, the panel
refreshes — so the pattern gets built once on top of the reworked interface.

- [#7](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/7) Rename files and directories
- [#8](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/8) Delete files and directories
- [#9](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/9) Create directories
- [#5](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/5) Toggle hidden files
- [#35](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/35) **Recursive directory download.** Recursion only exists for uploads today; this is
  the symmetric half of [#1](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/1).

Requires extending the client interface with rename and remove operations.

## v0.4.0 — Connections and authentication

- [#36](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/36) **Configuration layer** — named connection profiles are stored in
  `~/.lazyftp/config.json`; server passwords are plaintext but the file is restricted to the user on POSIX systems.
  SSH key passphrases are not stored. Connection history, bookmarks and themes remain future work.
- [#4](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/4) Extend profile management with additional favorite-connection workflows
- [#3](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/3) Connection history with quick reconnect
- [#37](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/37) **SSH-agent authentication** is deferred. SFTP identity-file
  authentication, including passphrase-protected keys, is available alongside password auth.
- [#38](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/38) **Host key verification**, removing the current accept-anything placeholder.
- [#53](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/53) **Read connections from `~/.ssh/config`** — servers the user already maintains for
  `ssh` and `scp`, available with nothing to configure. Suggested by a user in #4.
- [#39](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/39) Connect from the command line.
- [#41](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/41) Recover a dropped SFTP session. FTP already survives idle timeouts through goftp's
  connection pool; SFTP holds a single session with no equivalent.
- [#42](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/42) Loadable community themes, on top of the tokens from #25.

## v0.5.0 — Transfer queue and permissions

- [#6](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/6) Remember pending transfers across restarts, offering them back as new transfers.
  Not a resumable queue: resuming is goftp's job, unblocked in v0.1.2 by #54.
- [#10](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/10) Change permissions on remote files, through the inline input from v0.3.0. SFTP
  only: goftp has no chmod, and `SITE CHMOD` is outside the FTP standard.
- [#44](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/44) **Cancellable transfers and a concurrency limit.** Transfers spawn unbounded
  goroutines with no way to abort them.
- [#45](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/45) **Overwrite protection** — existing files are clobbered silently today.
- [#46](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/46) Transfer speed and estimated time.
- [#47](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/47) Confirm before quitting with transfers in flight.

## Someday

Ideas worth keeping but outside what lazyftp is for, or needing groundwork the project does
not have. Nothing here blocks a release.

- [#51](https://github.com/MawCeron/lazyftp/issues/51) One-way directory mirror. Deciding what "differs" needs guarantees plain FTP does
  not give — no checksums, and timestamps unreliable enough that goftp ships a setting to
  compensate. A mirror that gets it wrong silently skips a changed file. rsync and lftp
  already solve this from the same terminal.

Editing and previewing remote files were considered and dropped: lazyftp moves files, and the
editor and pager the user already has are better at reading and changing them.

## Toward v1.0

After v0.5.0 the goal is to stabilize the configuration format and the key bindings so they
can be committed to, and tag v1.0.0.
